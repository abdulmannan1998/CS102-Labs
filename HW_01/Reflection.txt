By this time, I realised that I was going about this wrong, so picking up other groups' templates and code, I added it all
to my own and arranged it to get a clearer sense of what was going on. I deleted all the non-essential code and kept the rest.
Then I had to clear out all the speeling mistakes and missing semi-colons. After that since my group had declared all 
properties as String, I had to change them to StringBuffer and also had to change the methods to return String by adding
".toString" to all the variables we were getting. Then, I had to rewrite the TryThis method as I couldn't make heads
or tails of the other groups' code. One last problem that occured was that the gamw wouldn't end one way or another. Eventually
I discovered that we had to compare the StringBuffer by converting it to String first. After that the code Started working
fine as can be checked.
